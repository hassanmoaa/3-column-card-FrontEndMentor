### What I learned

Practiced my media query skills and responsiveness, also second time to actually put my Grid Skills into practice so it was really wonderful!

```
    .container {
    max-width: 375px;

    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}

.anchor:hover,
.anchor:focus {
    background-color: transparent;
    color: white;
    border: 2px solid white;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to learn more about css by creating multi-page websites
